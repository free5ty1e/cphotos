CPhotos: A Local Replacement for the GPhotos (Google Photos) cloud archival service that you control.  With compression and optimization to JPEG &amp; H.265 HEVC MP4.

TODO: Extract CPhotos service from https://github.com/free5ty1e/debianusbfileserver/blob/master/README.md


NOTES:
Initial "Google Photos" downloaded media total 377GB for my collection.  Will post after results once CPhotos has a chance to fully process this entire collection to HD resolution, any videos to h.265 with compression rate factor 34, any JPEGs optimized and shrunk, any non-GIF imagery shrunk.  JSON files copied over intact for any metadata I might want.
